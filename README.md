# Unnati

A donation-based  dApp on Polygon where users can start a fundraising project for anyone to contribute and support the campaign by pledging the amount of their wish. 

## Problem
Donors typically have little to no knowledge of how non-profit or philanthropic groups use the money they receive. It is very impossible for donors to tell whether their donations are genuinely having an impact at the grassroots level despite the monthly or yearly reports. We have no useful means of tracking monetary or in-kind donations due to the opaque nature of traditional and centralized charitable institutions. At best, the data we have access to is aggregated and doesn't give us a precise picture of who exactly benefited from our donations or how. According to numerous surveys, the reason why about one-third of people worldwide lack faith in charitable activities is because of their lack of accountability.


## Vision
By creating innovative fundraising technology, we empower people, companies, and nonprofits to support the causes they care about in the moments when they feel inspired and uplift communities everywhere.

## The Functionalities

1. **Start New Campaign**  — users will be able to start a new crowdfunding project by inputting some details about the campaign like title, story and goal amount to be raised.
2. **View Projects** — users can see all the existing projects and campaign details on the homepage 
3. **Make Donation** — anyone can fund to the project they want to support in Matic tokens
